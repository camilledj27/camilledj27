Hello! 

My name is Camille Joie De Jesus and I graduated from the University of Maryland College Park in May 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 

I am currently working a professional website for myself using JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

I am also working on adding more features to an Android app using Kotlin that me and a few classmates worked on during the Fall 2020 semester. The app allows users to create an account and record any thoughts or feelings into a virtual diary. 

A project that I want to work on in the near future would be a character statistics calculator using Java for the video game Genshin Impact. In Genshin Impact, you can add certain items that can change the statistics, such as HP, attack, and defense, of a given character. Sometimes the items can change the statistics of the entire party too, so I wanted to make a program that will provide all of the data. Genshin Impact is a game that I enjoy playing and is my favorite video game of all time, so I really look forward to starting this project!
