Hello! 

My name is Camille Joie De Jesus and I graduated from the University of Maryland College Park in May 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am currently working towards receiving a Masters of Information Technology in Software Engineering. I've worked as both a Mobile Software Engineer and Full Stack/DevOps Engineer for the past 3 years and I hope to expand my knowledgy in technology to become a great engineer that others can look to for guidance.
