Hello! 

My name is Camille Joie De Jesus and I graduated from the University of Maryland College Park in May 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am currently working towards receiving a Masters of Information Technology in Software Engineering. I've been working as both a Mobile Software Engineer and a Scrum Master for the past almost 2 years and I hope to expand my knowledgy in technology to become a great engineer that others can look to for guidance. 

I currently focus on the front end for mobile Android devices using JavaScript, React Native, Java, and HTML/CSS. I am currently shifting towards doing more backend work using C# and Entity Framework.
